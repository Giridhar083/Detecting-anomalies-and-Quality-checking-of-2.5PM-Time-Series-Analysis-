#Time Series Anomaly Detection in Air Pollution Data Using GANs
This project implements a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to identify and flag anomalies in PM2.5 air quality time series data. It also includes a CycleGAN framework for cross-domain data quality checking between different sensor datasets.

This system is designed to improve the reliability of air quality monitoring, which is often compromised by sensor errors, data inconsistencies, and missing values.

## 1. Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement
Air quality monitoring is crucial for public health, but the reliability of IoT-based sensor data (like PM2.5) is often compromised by sensor errors and data inconsistencies. Traditional analysis methods struggle to differentiate genuine pollution events from these sensor errors in complex time series data.

### Objectives
Develop a robust Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to automatically detect anomalies in PM2.5 air quality time series data.
Utilize the trained GAN to identify data points that deviate significantly from learned patterns of normal behavior.
Implement a CycleGAN framework for cross-domain quality checking and validation between different sensor data sources.

## 2. System Design
The system consists of two primary components:

#### A. GAN for Anomaly Detection (AnoGAN-style)
This model is trained only on normal PM2.5 data to learn its underlying distribution and identify anomalies as sequences with a high reconstruction error.

Generator (G): An LSTM-based network (using layers of 128 and 64 units) that learns to generate realistic time series sequences of normal PM2.5 data from a random noise vector.

Discriminator (D): An LSTM-based classifier (using layers of 128 and 64 units) that distinguishes between real sequences from the dataset and "fake" sequences from the generator.

#### B. CycleGAN for Quality Checking
This is a separate model used to validate data consistency between two different sensor datasets (Domains A and B). It uses two generators and two discriminators built with 1D CNNs.

Generator G_AB: Translates data from Domain A to Domain B.

Generator G_BA: Translates data from Domain B to Domain A.

Discriminator D_A: Tries to identify "Fake A" sequences (generated by G_BA).

Discriminator D_B: Tries to identify "Fake B" sequences (generated by G_AB).

The model is trained using adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss to ensure that data translated from one domain to the other and back retains its original characteristics.

## 3. Technologies & Libraries Used
This project is built using Python 3 in a Kaggle/Colab notebook environment, accelerated by a T4 GPU.

### Core Libraries:
TensorFlow (Keras) 
Pandas 
NumPy 
Scikit-learn (for MinMaxScaler, PCA, TSNE) 
Matplotlib 
Joblib (for saving/loading models) 
OS 
tqdm 

## 4. Future Scope
Potential improvements for this project include:
Performance: Address the computational intensity of the detection phase for real-time deployment.
Multivariate Analysis: Extend the model to handle multiple pollutants simultaneously (e.g., NO2, PM10, O3, CO).
Thresholding: Develop an adaptive threshold mechanism rather than a static one.
Data Strategy: Explore data augmentation and federated learning to improve model generalization.
